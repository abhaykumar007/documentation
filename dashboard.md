# Dashboard Page Documentation

## Introduction

The **Dashboard** page provides a comprehensive overview of the farm's key metrics and real-time data. It consists of three primary sections:

1. **General Information** – Displays various farm statistics and metrics.
2. **Weather** – Shows real-time weather conditions and a 7-day forecast.
3. **Sensor Details Carousel** – Presents data from sensors across the farm’s various sections (Polyhouses, Zones, and Nurseries).

This page helps users stay updated with the farm's operational status and environmental conditions at a glance.

## Features

### 3. Sensor Details Carousel

The sensor details carousel displays real-time sensor data for different sections of the farm:

- **Polyhouse**: Shows sensor data (e.g., temperature, humidity, CO2 levels) specific to the polyhouse.
- **Zones**: Displays sensor readings for individual zones within the farm.
- **Nurseries**: Displays sensor data for nurseries across the farm.
- **Auto-scrolling**: The carousel automatically scrolls through the data of each section, giving users an easy view of the farm’s environment.

Each sensor card includes:

### 5. Interactive Sections

- Each sensor card includes real-time data. The cards are organized into categories (Polyhouse, Zones, Nurseries) and can be identified by tags (e.g., **Polyhouse**, **Zone**, **Nursery**).

## Troubleshooting

### Sensor Data Not Displaying

- If no data is displayed in any of the sensor cards, ensure that the sensors are properly connected and transmitting data. You may need to check the sensor configurations.

### Weather Data Not Loading

- If the weather data is not showing, confirm that your internet connection is active, as the data is pulled from a remote weather service. If issues persist, contact support for further assistance.
